Novice
======

This is the trickiest section of the lot! You're new to FP and as of yet don't
even know what you don't know! This stage is marked by excessive googling and
confusion; you'll hear a lot of new words and will eventually begin to
recognize a few of them. Some of them you'll be able to look up and understand
after a blog post or Wikipedia article, others you'll soon realize you'll have
to revisit later and that's okay! Try to keep a glossary of terms you've heard
and where you think they might fit in, this will help you structure new things
you learn in terms of things you already know. This section will take a while;
you'll have to put in a lot of leg work without seeing a whole lot of payoff,
but don't worry it DOES pay off later! It'll seem strange to need to learn a
lot of algebra and mathematic concepts like Functors, Monoids and Groups; after
all you never needed to know those for programming in Python or C, but soon you'll
start to recognize how that for-loop is actually just a Monoidal Sum; or how
that data-type you use in that algorithm is better expressed as a Functor!

General Resources
-----------------
There are a wealth of tutorials on basic concepts, but it's tricky because they're
all aimed at different levels of understanding. The best advice I can give is to
find one primary resource such as a book or a comprehensive series of blog posts and
to follow it along to completion. Supplement it with additional resources if you get
stuck or need a bit of extra insight, and if you get stuck just keep moving and come
back when you understand other parts better, maybe it'll click then!

### Recommendations:

-   [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)
    -   I highly recommend as a primary resource. This book alone will take you
        through all the skills in the Novice section.
-   [Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia)
    -   This provides a solid overview of the basic typeclasses you'll
        encounter in the wild (Functor, Applicative, Monad...) with examples
        and explanations
-   [The Extended Functor Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZPXzJ5tp9w)
    - Conference talk covering from basic to advanced Functors
